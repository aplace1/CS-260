## Data Structures and Algorithms

**Note:** The dataset and additional header files used to compile the original project are not included.

The code for this project shows several methods of searching, sorting, and manipulating data using algorithms.

### Algorithms Used:
- Linear sort
- Quick Sort

### Data Structures used:
- Vectors
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Hash Table
